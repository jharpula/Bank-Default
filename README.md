Bank Defaults
What is the problem you want to solve? 
Find out what is causing loan defaults for our client. 

Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? 
The client, a bank, is looking to find out what factors are causing loan defaults. The bank can use the data in two ways. First, they can tweak their criteria for loan originations to protect themselves from default but also the customer from handing out more than they can handle. Second, the bank can also use the information real-time to predict who might go into default as the loan is being paid off and perhaps work with the client on an equitable solution (I will assume the bank is a good neighbor and wishes to work with clients!)

What data are you using? How will you acquire the data?
The data was taken from the UCI Machine learning repository. It includes 23 independent variables pertaining to loan details, demographics, education, and payment history. The data includes numerical and categorical data. There are 30,000 rows of data. 

Briefly outline how youâ€™ll solve this problem. Your approach may change later, but this is a good first step to get you thinking about a method and solution.
We will solve the data using a machine learning pipeline that includes data wrangling, initial data exploration, model building and tuning, model analysis, and a final report outlining everything for a technical and non-technical audience.
